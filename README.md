# BIS-project

The selected case study for the Business Information Systems (BIS) project is the Business Process
Intelligence Challenge1 proposed in 2020 by the International Conference on Process Mining.
The data comes from the reimbursement process at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e).
In many organizations, staff members travel for work. They travel to customers, to conferences or to
project meetings and these travels are sometimes expensive. As an employee of an organization, you
do not have to pay for your own travel expenses, but the company takes care of them. At TU/e, this
is no different. The TU/e staff travels a lot to conferences or to other universities for project meetings
and/or to meet up with colleagues in the field. And, as many companies, they have procedures in
place for arranging the travels as well as for the reimbursement of costs. This data is split into travel
permits and several request types, namely domestic declarations, international declarations, prepaid
travel costs and requests for payment, where the latter refers to expenses which should not be related
to trips (representation costs, hardware purchased for work, ...).
The challenge is to analyze these data using whatever techniques available, focusing on one or
more of the process ownerâ€™s questions or proving other unique insights into the
process(es) captured in the event log.
